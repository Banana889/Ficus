README: [中文](./README-zh) | [English](./README.md)

$\tt{Ficus}$ is a software for editing and managing `markdown` documents, developed by the $\tt{gg=G}$ team.

$\tt{Ficus}$ is named after the fig tree, which has the characteristics of "umbrella-like canopy, and one tree forming a forest". This is also the core service that this software wants to provide to users: to allow users' md documents to be browsed and edited like a fig tree, and to allow users' multiple md documents to be associated in various forms like a fig forest. We hope that users' experience is like the slogan of this software:
$$
Branch \space out \space your \space idea \space with \space \mathcal F \mathcal i \mathcal c \mathcal u \mathcal s.
$$
$\tt{Ficus}$ is developed based on the `Vue3, Electron` framework and provides installation packages for Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.

Detailed information can be obtained on the [ficus website](https://ficus.world/).
